# Anagram solver

Small program that I wrote to solve anagram a few monthes ago. You provide hint the anagram and hints and it will returns all the possible anagram in french. Could work in another language with the right `dictionnaire` file.

```
$ ./main.rb "BANALEMENT PAUVRE" "**é****** **e****"
préambule avenant
```
