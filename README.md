# Anagram solver

Small program that I wrote to solve anagram a few monthes ago. You provides the anagram and a hint as entries and it will returns all the possible french anagrams. Could work in another language with the right `dictionnaire` file.

```
$ ./main.rb "BANALEMENT PAUVRE" "**é****** **e****"
préambule avenant
```
